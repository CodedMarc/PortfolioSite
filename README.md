One of my goals for my own portfolio site was to make it unique and representative of myself.
I enjoy music, video games, and programming. One of the things that got me into programming was video games.
I would make Minecraft plugins for servers when I was 14-15 years old as a little hobby of mine. 

I've always liked the pixel aesthetic as it reminded me of older video games, and decided to go with a pixel fonts as well as a homage to Minecraft.
Luckily, I already had a pixel portrait of myself drawn, with my favorite colors in the background, a few years ago created by a creator on Fiverr.
I wanted my site to match the aesthetic of my pixel portrait, as well as have some videogame-esque to it.
Lastly, I wanted to add some chill, relaxing lofi background music that could be muted.
